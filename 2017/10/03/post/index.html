        <p>The military justice system …</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>The ABC published leaked defence force documents a while ago that allege Australian special forces soldiers in Afghanistan committed acts such as possible unlawful killings. If the allegations are found to be true, how could those involved be charged and prosecuted?</p>
<h2 id="What-is-the-system-and-how-is-it-established"><a href="#What-is-the-system-and-how-is-it-established" class="headerlink" title="What is the system and how is it established?"></a>What is the system and how is it established?</h2><p>The military justice system is a generic term which covers functions such as discipline in the Australian Defence Force, administrative action to support ADF policy, inquiries to establish facts relevant to operation and command of the ADF, and the provisions for review and management of complaints.</p>
<p>The system is essential to ADF operational effectiveness and it complies with Commonwealth laws. Military members are subject to the same laws as apply to other Australians. The military justice system applies to all ranks. All ADF members have an interest in the success of the system</p>
<p>In 1982 the Federal Government introduced the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 (DFDA) as a part of Commonwealth law. This law became effective in 1985, and all ADF members are subject to it. This includes the director of military prosecutions, who prosecutes Australian Defence Force (ADF) members for serious criminal conduct. The act also sets up our system of military tribunals, including defence force magistrates and courts martial.</p>
<p>The purpose of the DFDA is to maintain and enforce military discipline. This includes offences that are uniquely military and other offences that occur in a military environment.</p>
<p>The act also sets out the “service offences” that can be committed by defence members (and a small category of civilians). There are three broad kinds of offences:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Those that are unique to the defence force, such as disobeying a lawful general order or being absent without leave;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Those that are similar to civilian offences but have specific service aspects to them – for example, assaulting a superior officer. In light of the discipline implications, sometimes these offences have penalties far more severe than their civilian counterparts; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Those that are more directly analogous to civilian offences in the sense that they are not as military-specific – for example, assault. This last category contains “territory offences”. These are criminal offences that apply to the Jervis Bay Territory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Offences by ADF members are prosecuted under the DFDA, within the military justice system, when the offence substantially affects the maintenance and ability to enforce Service discipline in the ADF. Otherwise, criminal offences or other illegal conduct are referred to civil authorities, such as the police.</p>
<p>The military justice system provides the ADF with an Australian legal framework able to be applied on operations anywhere in the world. This is essential because the ADF may conduct operations in countries where the civil system has broken down and no law applies.</p>
<p>The military justice system applies to all ADF members in times of peace and war, whether in Australia or overseas. ADF members must maintain the high level of discipline required on operations, at all times.</p>

<h2 id="What-are-territory-offences"><a href="#What-are-territory-offences" class="headerlink" title="What are territory offences?"></a>What are territory offences?</h2><p>Territory offences are those punishable under any law in force in the Jervis Bay Territory. The Jervis Bay Territory is under Commonwealth jurisdiction and largely subject to the ACT’s laws.</p>
<p>Specifically, this includes the Crimes Act, and the ACT common law. But a territory offence does not need to have been committed in the Jervis Bay Territory – and so it applies to offences committed by ADF troops overseas.</p>
<p>The effect of this is that territory offences incorporate the entire range of criminal offences into the Defence Force Discipline Act. This includes the most serious crimes – such as murder, assault, and sexual-based violence.</p>
<h2 id="Prosecution-for-war-crimes"><a href="#Prosecution-for-war-crimes" class="headerlink" title="Prosecution for war crimes"></a>Prosecution for war crimes</h2><p>The director of military prosecutions may also choose to prosecute ADF members under the Commonwealth Criminal Code.</p>
<p>The code creates several war crimes. These offences are territory offences, and are also subject to universal jurisdiction. This means it does not matter whether or not the conduct constituting the alleged offence occurs in Australia.</p>
<p>The code also includes command responsibility as a mode of criminal liability. This means commanders can be criminally liable if they knew or were reckless about whether their troops were committing offences, and they failed to take “all necessary and reasonable measures” within their power to prevent or repress the offences, or to submit the matter to a competent authority for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-courts-martial-and-defence-force-magistrates"><a href="#What-are-courts-martial-and-defence-force-magistrates" class="headerlink" title="What are courts martial and defence force magistrates?"></a>What are courts martial and defence force magistrates?</h2><p>Proceedings for serious service offences are held before courts martial or defence force magistrates. These proceedings are headed by civilian judicial officers, who are also serving members of the military (usually reservists).</p>
<p>These service tribunals have broadly the same rules of evidence and procedure – and protections for the accused – as civilian courts.</p>
<p>Courts martial consist of a judge advocate and a panel of military officers, who are called the members of the court. The judge advocate’s role is to make rulings on questions of law and procedure. The members of the court make findings of fact and determine punishment.</p>
<p>These service tribunals’ decisions are subject to review by the chain of command, and can be appealed to the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Tribunal.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-the-rules-of-engagement"><a href="#What-are-the-rules-of-engagement" class="headerlink" title="What are the rules of engagement?"></a>What are the rules of engagement?</h2><p>The rules of engagement regulate the conduct of Australian troops. The federal government formulate them for particular operations.</p>
<p>These rules are based on domestic and international law, as well as policy requirements and other considerations such as status of forces agreements. Accordingly, the formulation process ordinarily involves the departments of Defence, Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Attorney-General.</p>
<p>The rules of engagement for any given operation are not law as such, and reflect the government’s decisions. This means they may be narrower than the law. So, the rules of engagement may forbid acts that either Australian domestic law or international law would otherwise permit.</p>
<p>While the rules of engagement are not law, they ordinarily apply to ADF members as a lawful order for the purposes of the Defence Force Discipline Act. This means that a failure to comply with the rules is a service offence.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-the-role-of-the-international-humanitarian-law"><a href="#What-is-the-role-of-the-international-humanitarian-law" class="headerlink" title="What is the role of the international humanitarian law?"></a>What is the role of the international humanitarian law?</h2><p>International humanitarian law, also known as the law of armed conflict, it is the primary body of international law that seeks to regulate belligerents’ conduct in armed conflict.</p>
<p>The law consists of several treaties, including the four Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols, as well as a large body of customary international law.</p>
<p>These rules set out what is and isn’t permissible in armed conflict. The overarching aim is to alleviate the suffering of war by protecting those who are not part of the fight, such as civilians or medical personnel, and restricting the means and methods of warfare.</p>
<p>This law forms the basis for international war crimes law, such as the offences found in Article 8 of the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court. It also provides the foundation for the offences in Australia’s Commonwealth Criminal Code.</p>
<p>Accordingly, if there were to be war crimes prosecutions under Australia’s code, then the prosecuting authority would probably draw from relevant international materials and the legal principles of international war crimes tribunals.</p>
