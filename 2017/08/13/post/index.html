        <p>If you’re in a Chinese city on a rainy day and need an umbrella, you might be able to use an app to find one hanging on a fence that you can rent. At least, that was the idea behind the startup company Sharing E Umbrella — until nearly all of its shareable umbrellas were stolen in just a few weeks.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>The Chinese company placed 300,000 rainbow umbrellas around 11 cities in the country, including Shanghai, Nanjing, and Guangzhou, according to a report last week by the Paper, a state-run Chinese media site.</p>
<p>Most were never returned.</p>
<p>Launched in April with a 10 million yuan (approx. US 1.4 million) investment, Sharing E Umbrella could now be in serious financial trouble. Each umbrella costs around 9 dollars to replace, so if all 300,000 were stolen, that would be a bill of 2.7 million.</p>
<p>But Zhao Shuiping, the company’s founder, said he still plans to unleash 30 million umbrellas across the country by the end of the year.</p>
<p>In an interview, Zhao said he was inspired by China’s bicycle-sharing industry and thought he could do the same with umbrellas. “We were all baffled by the model of dockless bike sharing; it made users think anything on the street can be shared now,” said Zhao.</p>
<p>But while China’s bike-sharing industry has been booming, it too has been hit by stealing citizens. Wukong Bike, a five-month-old bike-sharing startup, collapsed after 90 percent of its bikes were stolen, reported Financial Times. And the founder of the Beijing-based 3Vbike said he started with 1,000 bikes but was left with only a few dozen four months later, according to the Shanghaiist, an English-language blog on China.</p>
<p>Zhao wasn’t the only one inspired by the bike-sharing industry. Apparently there are 14 other umbrella-sharing companies in China, according to Sixth Tone, a Chinese state-run, English-language media outlet.</p>
<p>But it’s a baffling business model dependent on unpredictable weather and forgetful people.</p>
<p>It is unsurprising that the umbrella start-ups face a difficult situation, for they are different from bicycles. Whilst bikes can be parked anywhere, with an umbrella you always have to go that extra mile to find railings or a fence to hang it on.</p>
<p>Additionally, as Sixth Tone notes, many cities in China experience the most rain in the summer. But when it’s not the rainy season, there’s a question of whether there will be enough demand for the umbrellas for the businesses to stay profitable.</p>
<p>And it might just be cheaper in the long run for people to simply buy their own umbrellas and try not to forget them at home. For example, Sharing E Umbrella requires a deposit of 19 yuan, or about 4 dollars. Then there is a fee of 0.50 yuan for every 30 minutes you use it.</p>
<p>If Chinese cities are suddenly full of the same rainbow-colored umbrellas, now you know who to blame.</p>
